Users and Posts

For this assignment, you will be writing a simple iOS app using Objective-C/Swift to do the following:

1. Display a scrollable list of users with their name, username, email and phone.
2. On selecting a user, your app should display all the posts for that user with the title and body.
3. You can choose to display it however you wish. A UITableView will be the easiest to do. 
4. You can choose to display any image (randomized) for each user if you like.

Here are the 2 APIs youâ€™ll need: 
 - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
 - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=USER_ID
 
Persistence of data is not needed for this exercise.
